Why did you choose to study at the University of Copenhagen?

Ratings, program, proximity to home country, the city, environment.

Where is your favourite spot on campus?

The lobby of the main building of South Campus with the piano. The other weekend while I was studying someone started to play one of the Metamorphosis by Glass on the piano and it was just so amazing when sound filled the air.

Which of the courses you follow is your favourite and why?

I have one course at a time, so I enjoy every of them in a great depth.

Here is what Helle from Norway writes:

Why did you choose to study at the University of Copenhagen?

In Norway, we are very fascinated about Denmark, and Copenhagen especially. It attracts us somehow, Norwegians just love Denmark. My father was born in Denmark, so I was curious to learn more about this happy, relaxed and creative country. I remember thinking about how it would be like to live and study in Copenhagen, and I remember sitting on my room googling the University. I read some personal stories and experiences from previous students, and got immediately convinced that this could be it. This could be my future! 

Where is your favourite spot on campus?

Konsistorialgården is the place at campus that gives me the best and warmest feeling inside. I have participated in annual summer parties with my faculty there some years in a row, and it is a place with so much history. It is fascinating to think about and try to imagine all the crazy, weird, funny and beautiful things that have happened in that yard throughout the years. The start of new friendships, people dancing and earlier generations of students falling in love, to mention a few of the good ones. 

Which of the courses you follow is your favourite and why?

I think European Pharmaceutical law, IPR & the Life Sciences was an amazing course. What you learn is so useful, and you end up reading and looking for supplementary literature in your spare time not because you want to do well on you exam, but because you personally want to learn more about a certain subject. That hasn't happened a lot for me. UNCPH should be so proud to be cooperating with the greatly talented and very emphatic Timo Minssen. He is by far my favourite lecturer at UNCPH. He was gone last year, lecturing at Oxford I think, but I hear that he is back now. Lucky for the University!   

Where are your favourite Christmas lights in Copenhagen?

I will have to get back to you on this one. Honestly I have been mostly inside reading lately.

Why did you choose to study at the University of Copenhagen?

I chose to study at the University of Copenhagen because I was attracted to the research profile of University, especially in pharmaceutical sciences fields. I like a lot offered study line in the pharmacy, chance to choose you own courses and the ability to cooperate with companies.

Where is your favourite spot on campus?

The pharmacy campus is not the newest one :) My favourite spot there is a roof of the building, where you can have a great view for Copenhagen.
Other nice spots: Biological gardens and Black Diamond for studying and entertainment. 

Which of the courses you follow is your favourite and why?

I am kind of nerdy type person and I love science especially one involving drugs discovery and development. Therefore my favourite courses are: Molecular Pharmacology and In vitro techniques in Biochemistry and Pharmacology. I choose to take these courses because they are involving mostly laboratory exercises with focus of my field of interests.

Nominated for an Oscar and awarded at the Berlin Film Festival, ‘A Royal Affair’ tells about the dramatic love affair and political aspirations of Queen Caroline Mathilde and Johann Struensee (played by Mads Mikkelsen), physician to the deranged King Christian VII of Denmark. Through Struensee’s influence on the King's governance, reforms are introduced. But it is only a matter of time before the courtiers regain a hold on their King.

Only this Sunday at The Danish Film Institut : Don't miss it !
